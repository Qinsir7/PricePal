This is the MVP for Chainlink 2023 Spring Hackathon, and is built based on our previous product.

The biggest improvements include:
  1. Used Chainlink Automation for automatically monitoring on-chain and credibly compensating customers.
  2. Used Amazon Forecast service as efficient financing model for creating correctly priced derivatives.
  3. Extend our ideas to more products, e.g. paymaster subscription, based on the general protocol.
  4. Add more attractive UI for front-end.
  5. Tested on several L1 and L2s networks.
